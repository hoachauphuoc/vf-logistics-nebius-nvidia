/**
 * What Help mode says.
 *
 * Every entry is derived from the backend that actually implements the behaviour
 * -- the check functions and thresholds in `verifier.py`, the state tuples in
 * `orchestrator.py` -- rather than written from an idea of what the console
 * probably does. Help that describes behaviour the code does not have is worse
 * than no help: it is the one text on screen a reader has no way to verify, so it
 * gets believed.
 *
 * Numbers quoted here (500 USD/kg, 70% of the lane baseline, 100 USD) are the
 * live defaults. They are tenant-configurable through the Governance screen, so
 * the wording says "by default" wherever a rule can be re-tuned.
 *
 * Kept as plain data, separate from the components, so the copy can be reviewed
 * as prose without reading JSX.
