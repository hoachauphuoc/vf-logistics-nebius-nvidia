 * Which column a raw backend state is drawn in.
 *
 * The folding mirrors the backend's own AWAITING_HUMAN tuple, deliberately, so
 * that the "Awaiting a person" column and the "Awaiting human" KPI tile count the
 * same thing. They did not in the ported version: the old dashboard folded
 * BLOCKED_BY_HUMAN into the awaiting-human column, so the column header read 4
 * while the tile above it read 3, and the extra card was a shipment a reviewer had
 * already blocked. A case that has been refused is disposed of, not queued -- and
 * two numbers with the same name disagreeing on one screen is how an operator
 * learns to trust neither.
 *
 * BLOCKED_BY_HUMAN gets the sixth column outright, taking it from ESCALATED.
 * That trade is on purpose: ESCALATED is genuinely awaiting a person, so it reads
 * correctly folded in alongside the rest (with its own red card accent), whereas a
 * blocked shipment is the one outcome a compliance console must never bury in a
 * column labelled something else.
 *
 * RELEASED_BY_HUMAN folds into Cleared because that column means "cleared to
 * ship", not "cleared without a human" -- which is why it is no longer labelled
 * "Auto-cleared".
 *
 * DEAD_LETTER folds into the awaiting column: a case the workflow gave up on is
 * work for a person. It is therefore the one state that can make the column
 * exceed the tile, and that is the honest direction for the discrepancy to run.
