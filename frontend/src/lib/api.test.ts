/**
 * Two fixes that both turn a failure into something the reader can act on.
 *
 * 1. `fetchAuditTrail` returned the raw payload, so a response without `items` made
 *    `trail.data?.items ?? []` at the call site produce `[]` -- and the screen rendered
 *    "No audit records match" over a populated trail. `fetchReviewQueue` had already been
 *    hardened for exactly this, with a comment recording the same consequence; the fix
 *    was applied to one sibling and not the other.
 *
 * 2. There was no client-side timeout. The BFF proxy has one, but it governs the proxy's
 *    call to the backend rather than the browser's call to the proxy, and with
 *    `retry: false` on nearly every query a hung handler left a skeleton on screen with
 *    nothing to end it.
