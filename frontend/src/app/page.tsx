  /**
   * The board poll, and the only place in the console that asks for `drain=1`.
   *
   * GET /api/v1/orchestrator/state advances one case per request in ondemand
   * mode, so it is a write dressed as a read. Every screen polls something; if
   * they all asked for drain the console would be six competing pipeline
   * advancers racing each other and the B2B POST handler, which is exactly how
   * the optimistic-lock conflicts in the last round were produced. This screen
   * is the one whose job is to show work progressing, so it is the one that
   * drives it.
   *
   * Interval rather than a setTimeout chain because React Query's
   * `refetchInterval` already refuses to overlap: it schedules the next fetch
   * after the previous one settles. That is the property the old dashboard's
   * hand-rolled chain existed to get, with a comment explaining that setInterval
   * would stack requests. Same behaviour, and the fast/slow switch survives.
