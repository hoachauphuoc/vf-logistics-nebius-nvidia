/**
 * Scoped deliberately narrowly.
 *
 * This suite covers two things and no more: the `format.ts` helpers against absent
 * input, and each screen's loading / error / empty branches. Both are classes of bug
 * that have already shipped here -- `formatUsd(undefined)` blanked a page, and three
 * separate fields were read under a `!= null` guard that silently rendered nothing.
 *
 * What it deliberately does NOT do is snapshot components. A snapshot asserts that the
 * markup is what it currently is, which passes for as long as nobody looks at it, and
 * this project has already learned to distrust that shape of test: two backend tests
 * re-implemented the code in the test body and asserted on their own literal.
 *
 * No @vitejs/plugin-react: its dependency tree pulls a conflicting @babel/core, and it
 * exists for Fast Refresh, which tests do not use. Vitest transforms JSX through esbuild
 * using the `jsx: "react-jsx"` already set in tsconfig.json.
