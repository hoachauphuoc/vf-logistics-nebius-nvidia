    Billable usage for the calling tenant, optionally for one billing period.

    The tenant comes from the authenticated identity, not from a parameter, so
    one customer cannot read another's invoice by changing a query string.

    `since` and `until` ARE parameters, and safely so: they narrow the caller's own
    window and cannot widen its scope. Both are ISO-8601 UTC strings and the window
    is half-open, so consecutive periods neither double-count a case nor drop one.
    Without them the answer is lifetime-to-date, which is what a dashboard wants and
    what an invoice must not use -- the response says which it gave.

    `cleared_by_rules` versus `cleared_by_ai` is the unit-economics number rather
    than a curiosity: a shipment the deterministic checks settle costs no tokens
    at all, so the ratio is what decides whether a given customer is profitable to
    serve. Note those two are lifetime counts even in a windowed call, which the
    response states rather than hides.

    Rate limited, unlike before. This route runs five Firestore sum() aggregations
    plus two count() queries, each of which is itself billable, so leaving it on the
    200/min default meant a caller could spend real money asking what they had spent.
