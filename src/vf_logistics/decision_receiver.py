"""
The receiving side of the case-decisions topic, as part of Floorline (N01).

Floorline publishes every executed human decision at least once: a retry after an
unknown outcome reuses the approval's idempotency key, and Pub/Sub itself redelivers
a message whose acknowledgement was lost. This receiver turns that into once. It is
a Pub/Sub push endpoint (POST /api/v1/receiver/decision) that records each decision
in the store under its key, and the record IS the application: the create that
claims the key and the write that applies it are one transaction, so a repeat is
counted (deliveries) and never applied twice. Systems downstream read the applied
record instead of the topic.

Only a push Google signed for the configured service account and audience is
accepted; without that configuration nothing is (fail closed). A message that cannot
be deduplicated (no key, no case, no tenant where one is required) is refused with
422 and never applied: Pub/Sub keeps it, redelivers it or dead-letters it, for a
person to see. docs/RECEIVER_CONTRACT.md is the contract this implements.
