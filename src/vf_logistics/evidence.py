"""
Requests for documents, and the signed link a shipper answers them through.

Plan 1 of the 12/10 restructure proposal, step 2. A reviewer who cannot decide a case
from what is in front of them used to press "Request info" and write a sentence; the
case then sat in PENDING_HUMAN with nothing recording who was asked for what, or
whether it came. Here the request is a record of its own, inside the case:

    case["verification"] = {
        "evidence_version": 0,   # rises when new evidence arrives (step 3)
        "resume_state": None,    # where the case goes back to when no request is open
        "requests": [ {request_id, finding_codes, documents, owner, status, ...} ],
        "documents": [], "evaluations": [], "approvals": [], "executions": [],
    }

Embedded rather than stored apart so it shares the case's optimistic lock and its
tenant: a request and the state change it causes are one write, and cannot land
half-way. The cost is the 1 MiB Firestore document limit, so what is stored here is
metadata and extracted facts, never document bytes (those go to document_store).

THE LINK IS NOT IN THE CASE

The case JSON is readable by a viewer. A link stored in it would hand every viewer
the ability to submit "evidence" for that case, so the case keeps only a
fingerprint of each link issued and the link itself leaves exactly once, in the
response to the reviewer who asked. Lose it and the reviewer issues a new one,
which retires the old (the request's `link_seq` is in the token and compared on use).

THE CHANNEL IS A SANDBOX

Nothing is emailed. "sent" means a link was issued to a reviewer, who passes it on;
the request records that and no more. The console says so wherever it shows the
status, because a status that read "sent" with no sending would be the AI-written
claim the proposal asked this loop not to make.
