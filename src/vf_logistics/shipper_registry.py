"""
The internal counterparty book.

verifier.py refuses to take a shipper's trading history from a bill of lading,
because a document able to assert its own history could claim a long one. The
finding it raises says the history "is not available from internal records" -
but until this module existed there were no internal records to consult, so the
finding was permanent for every document and no uploaded or staged file could
ever clear autonomously. That was a gap, not a policy: the control was written
around an enrichment step that had not been built.

This is that step. It answers one question - "is this a counterparty we already
know, and what is our own record of them?" - from data the document cannot
influence. The document supplies the claimed identity; the answer comes from
here.

Identity is matched on tax ID *and* company name together, and both must agree.
Matching on tax ID alone would be weaker than it looks: the tax ID is itself
read off the untrusted document, so a forged bill of lading carrying a real
customer's number would inherit that customer's clean history. Requiring the
name to agree means impersonation has to be wholesale rather than opportunistic,
and a number that matches while the name does not is reported as a mismatch -
actively worse for the shipment than being unknown, which is the correct
treatment for paperwork bearing someone else's tax number.

The residual exposure is worth stating plainly rather than hiding: this verifies
a *claimed* identity against internal records, and the claim still arrives on
paper. A production system ties intake to a booking reference issued against a
customer account, so identity is established before any document is read. The
delegation ceiling in governance.py is what bounds the damage in the meantime -
a spoofed identity still cannot release cargo above the limit.
